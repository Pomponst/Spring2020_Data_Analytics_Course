# Assignment Week 10 Unit 2
*Tasks*
1. Create a scatter plot of price vs. sqft_living. You donâ€™t need axis labels but a chart title is required. Make it clear that this is data for zip code 98038.
2. Remove from your data set all homes with a price > $1,000,000.
3. Calculate the correlation between price and sqft_living.
4. Set a seed of 1000, then create a training set comprised of 60% of the data.
5. Create a test set of the remaining data (those elements in your original data frame not in the training set).
6. Verify that the number of rows in your training set and the number of rows in your test set sum to the number of rows in the data frame they were created from.
7. Use head() to show the default number of starting rows in train() and test().
8. Create a regression model of price vs. sqft_living, using your training data.
9. Provide the output of summary() applied to your regression model.
10. Apply your model to the test data; that is use your model to predict prices for the test data. Show the command you used here.
11. Provide below the commands (along with system output) to determine the summary values that measure the performance of your model on the test data.
