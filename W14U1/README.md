# Assignment Week 14 Unit 1
Download the Credit.csv file, read it into an R dataframe and take a look at the data. The objective here is to develop the best linear regression model for predicting Balance, an individual’s credit card balance, **using the data analytics approach**.

Variable Meaning (where not obvious):<br>
Limit: Credit limit<br>
Rating: Credit rating<br>
Cards: Number of credit cards<br>
Education: Highest level of education<br>
Area: Location of card holder; one of Urban, Suburban, Rural.
1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Start by getting a sense of the data, and which variables might be useful predictors of Balance. You should use all relevant approaches we’ve covered. This analysis should provide you with a good sense of each variable both independently and how they relate to each other.
2. Partition the data: Partition the data using the approach from class. **Be sure to set the seed to 2020 in the command just prior to sampling**.
3. Create regression models: Given your work above and what you know about developing linear regression models, create and evaluate any and all relevant models using the training data. The idea is to include in the regression all useful independent variables and to exclude those that are not helpful. You should be very clear about how you decide which model(s) to apply to the test set and why.
4. Evaluation: Evaluate your selected model(s) on the test set.
