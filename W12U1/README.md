# Assignment Week 12 Unit 1
### Valley Publishing - Yearbook Pricing (A)
In the early summer of 2012, Donna Griffin, president and owner of Valley Publishing, met with Kent Bowen, Head of Valley Publishing's yearbook operations, to determine what changes should be made in preparing high school yearbook cost estimates for the coming academic year.  Generally, the company received a set of specifications from each of several high schools during June-August.  Kent Bowen, or his assistant, would then develop a cost estimate for each school's contract based on the detailed components of that book (number of pages, material costs, binding cost, cover complexity, extra colors, number of books, etc.)  In all, about 24 separate costs were estimated and then these were added together to get a total cost estimate.  Once this was done (which took several hours for each contract), Kent would sit down with Donna Griffin and together they would decide what bid price to submit for that school's contract.  (Although most schools requested bids from three or more yearbook suppliers, less than half of such contracts were awarded strictly on price.)

It had been three years (2009) since Valley Publishing had revised and updated its yearbook cost estimating procedures.  During that period the company's costs had changed significantly, and in fact the previous summer (2011) Kent had started with the basic 2009 cost rates, but then found it necessary to add an overall adjustment factor of 14.5% in order to reflect the higher 2011 cost levels.  In the light of this and also because of the company's recent labor problems, both Kent and Donna felt that either an entirely new set of cost rates should be developed or that a new procedure for estimating should be developed.  In line with the latter approach, Kent had suggested that regression analysis might provide the basis for an entirely new estimating procedure that would be more accurate, less costly and yet simpler to use than just an updated version of the existing procedure.  With Donna's approval, he decided to pursue this possibility.

As a first step in developing a regression analysis approach, Kent collected data on the 20 high school contracts that Valley Publishing had just completed.  The four variables he examined initially were:

Actual cost
Number of books
Number of pages/book
Number of color pages/book

The actual 2011/2012 data he used are shown below.

1. Develop a regression model using cost as the dependent variable and the other three factors as independent variables.  Evaluate this model.
2. Try running cost vs. books and pages/book.
3. Try any other models you think might be appropriate.

Kent presented his analysis and recommendations to Donna.  Much to Kent's surprise, Donna was not enthusiastic about immediately adopting the regression analysis model.  She raised a number of questions about how the regression results compared with the results of the cost estimating procedures actually used for the 2011/2012 contracts and how these regression results might have compared with regression performed on some prior year's data.  As a first step in answering Donnaâ€™s questions, Kent obtained the data on Valley Publishing's 2010/2011 high school contracts shown below.

1. For this data, develop a regression model using cost as the dependent variable and the other three factors as independent variables.
2. Again, try running cost vs. books and pages/book.
3. Try any other models you think might be appropriate.
